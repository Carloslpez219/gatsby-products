# ðŸ“˜ README â€“ Gatsby Fake Products Store

## Author

**Carlos Edgardo LÃ³pez Barrera**



## Project Overview

This project is a fake e-commerce store built with Gatsby.js.
It fetches products from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) at build time and generates:

* A main product listing page (grid layout with images, prices, categories, and descriptions).
* Individual product detail pages, dynamically created with `createPages`.
* Responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS.
* Utility functions for price formatting and reusable components like `Layout`.


## Features

* **Product List** â€“ Displays all products from the Fake Store API in a grid.
* **Product Detail Page** â€“ Each product has its own page (`/products/:id`) with full details.
* **Dynamic Routing** â€“ Gatsby `createPages` is used to generate product pages at build time.
* **API Integration** â€“ Products are fetched from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).
* **Responsive UI** â€“ Built with Tailwind CSS, optimized for mobile and desktop.

## Images and Product Data

All product data (titles, descriptions, prices, categories, and images) comes directly from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).
The API provides product images via a public URL, which are displayed directly in the app without additional configuration.

Example response from the API:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Fjallraven - Foldsack No. 1 Backpack",
  "price": 109.95,
  "description": "Your perfect pack for everyday use...",
  "category": "men's clothing",
  "image": "https://fakestoreapi.com/img/81fPKd-2AYL._AC_SL1500_.jpg"
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Data Sourcing**

   * In `gatsby-node.js`, the `sourceNodes` API fetches products from the Fake Store API.
   * Each product is transformed into a Gatsby node of type `FakeProduct`.

2. **Dynamic Page Creation**

   * The `createPages` API generates a product page for each item.
   * Pages are created under `/products/:id`.

3. **GraphQL Queries**

   * Gatsby exposes `allFakeProduct` for the list page.
   * Each product detail page uses `fakeProduct(id_original: { eq: $id })` to query a single product.

4. **UI Rendering**

   * The product list is rendered on the homepage (`src/pages/index.js`).
   * Product detail pages are rendered with a template (`src/templates/product.js`).
   * Tailwind CSS provides styling, responsive grid, and hover effects.
